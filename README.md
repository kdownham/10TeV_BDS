# 10TeV_BDS
Code for the optimization and analysis of the beam delivery system for a 10 TeV Plasma Wakefield Collider. 

## Requirements
Conda environment with Xsuite installed. Instructions for installing conda through miniforge are here: https://xsuite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#install-miniforge (skip the last command, since this grabs the wrong 
version of XSuite). For the installation of XSuite I follow the "Developer Installation" instructions on the XSuite page (https://xsuite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#developer-installation) as this will grab the 
most recent versions of each of the software packages.
